# Movie Magic ðŸ“½

Welcome to Movie Magic â€“ the ultimate platform for transforming your movie-watching experience! This app has been designed with the goal of providing a one-stop solution for users to seamlessly explore, assess, and organize their cinematic interests. Whether you're a seasoned movie enthusiast or a casual viewer, Movie Magic caters to the diverse needs of all users.

Built using Dart and the Flutter Framework, the site offers a modern and responsive design. Users can search through our catalogue of movies by interacting with tabs on our home page, or be searching for movies directly. If a user chooses to, they can save/favorite a movie which is stored on their profile to be viewed later. 

Movie Magic pulls Movie Data from the [TBDI](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) API. API calls are made in Dart which serves as the backend in our application, handling all API calls and making them servable to our users. 

User data - name, email, saved movies - are stored in a **Google Cloud** PostgreDB instance.
